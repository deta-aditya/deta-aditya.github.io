Hello! I'm Muhammad **Deta** Aditya, and I'm a software engineer who loves coding and learning new things.

I've been programming since 2012, and I have never stopped programming since then. I might even say I find it _fun_ to program - most of the time. I attended vocational high school with major in Software Engineering, and I continued my study in university with major in Computer Science. During my time as a student, I've been involved as practicuum assistant for several courses, freelance projects, and internships. I've also been involved in several competitions. More on that later!

Currently I'm working as a Software Engineer - Web Platform at [Tokopedia](https://www.tokopedia.com/), one of the biggest e-commerce in Indonesia. I'm currently in charge of developing and maintaining TopAds platform, which is a platform for sellers to advertise their products. In addition to that, I also used to work as a Back End Engineer in which I was in charge of developing and maintaining the Display Search API for TopAds.

While I know several programming languages, I'm most comfortable with TypeScript - and JavaScript. Other languages that I'm familiar with are Dart, PHP, Go, C#, Python, Java, Ruby, C++. I'm also familiar with several frameworks and libraries, such as React, Vue, Angular, Flutter, Express, Laravel, .NET Core, and Flask. Currenly, I'm exploring Rust - which is a super cool language - and functional programming languages such as F#, Elm, and Haskell. They have a lot of interesting concepts! Sometimes I wish I could use them in my daily job without having to worry about confusing my teammates.

While I mostly work on front-end and back-end development, my biggest interest right now is on codebase maintainability, testability, and reusability using some concepts of functional programming. I believe that code standards are often overlooked - at least in most places I've been working at - and I want to bring the awareness of it to all programmers I'm working with. I believe that code standards are about how we write our code, how we structure our code, and how we test our code, instead of clean codes or coding styles, and I also believe that using functional programming concepts can help us achieve that. It's such a deep iceberg that I often tremble in excitement when thinking about it. I will mostly write about this topic in my blog, so stay tuned!

Okay, enough talk about programming! Let's get into my interests. I am a huge fan of One Piece, which is an epic adventure manga about a man named Monkey D. Luffy in his quest to find One Piece. It already has about 1.000+ chapters, and each new chapter releases are always amazing! I'm also glad that they made a decent live-action version of One Piece. It helps people who are not used to manga/anime a chance to experience its glory. I really recommend everyone to read it, or watch the live action. It's such a masterpiece!

I also play games. I've been exposed to computer games - and to computers in general - since I was 4. I played Red Alert (2 and 3), Re-Volt, RollerCoaster Tycoon (1, 2, and 3), Age of Empires II, SimCity 4, One Piece Pirate Warriors III, Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm VI, Civilization VI, Minecraft, Stardew Valley, and many other minor games. But the game that I would say my all time favorite is Factorio. It is such a masterpiece of a game that itches my brain the same way programming does. I've spent more than 1.000 hours playing it, and I'm still not bored of it. There are many overhaul mods that give the game an even more hundreds of hours of playtime. Unfortunately (or rather, thankfully), I don't have much time to play games anymore right now.

Currently, I've been preparing for the next stage of my life, which is marriage. The most difficult part of it is preparation. Gosh, marriage is such a huge step in life, isn't it? It might even takes 1-2 years, but I'm sure me and my girlfriend be able to get through it. Kudos to her for being so supportive and understanding. I'm really grateful to have her in my life! Career wise, I'm really looking forward to go international. I want to work in a company that has a global impact. I think working in a SEA countries, such as Singapore, would be a great stepping stone. There are a lot of opportunities waiting out there and I really look forward to it!

Wow, that's a lot of things about me! I hope you enjoy reading it. If you want to know more about me, feel free to contact me through my social media or email. I'm always open to new opportunities and new friends. Have a nice day~

Cheers!
